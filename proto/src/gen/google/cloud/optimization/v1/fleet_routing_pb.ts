   *
   * If a `vehicle_label` in the injected solution does not correspond to a
   * request vehicle, the corresponding route is removed from the solution
   * along with its visits. If a `shipment_label` in the injected solution does

   * Removing route visits or entire routes from an injected solution may
   * have an effect on the implied constraints, which may lead to change in
   * solution, validation errors, or infeasibility.

 *  start     (arrival)   (departure)   start   end      start    end     end
 * ```
 * Note that we make a difference between:
 *
 * * "punctual events", such as the vehicle start and end and each visit's start
 *   and end (aka arrival and departure). They happen at a given second.
 * * "time intervals", such as the visits themselves, and the transition between
 *   visits. Though time intervals can sometimes have zero duration, i.e. start
 *   and end at the same second, they often have a positive duration.
 *
 * Invariants:
 *
 * * If there are n visits, there are n+1 transitions.
 * * A visit is always surrounded by a transition before it (same index) and a
 *   transition after it (index + 1).
 * * The vehicle start is always followed by transition #0.
 * * The vehicle end is always preceded by transition #n.
 *
 * Zooming in, here is what happens during a `Transition` and a `Visit`:
 * ```
 * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-->
 *    |           TRANSITION[i]             |           VISIT[i]          |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * TRAVEL: the vehicle moves from   |      PERFORM the visit:     |
 *    |    VISIT[i-1].departure_location to |                             |
 *    |    VISIT[i].arrival_location, which |  * Spend some time:         |
 *    |    takes a given travel duration    |    the "visit duration".    |
 *    |    and distance                     |                             |
 *    |                                     |  * Load or unload           |
 *    |  * BREAKS: the driver may have      |    some quantities from the |
 *    |    breaks (e.g. lunch break).       |    vehicle: the "demand".   |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * WAIT: the driver/vehicle does    |                             |
 *    |    nothing. This can happen for     |                             |
 *    |    many reasons, for example when   |                             |
 *    |    the vehicle reaches the next     |                             |
 *    |    event's destination before the   |                             |
 *    |    start of its time window         |                             |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 *    |  * DELAY: *right before* the next   |                             |
 *    |    arrival. E.g. the vehicle and/or |                             |
 *    |    driver spends time unloading.    |                             |
 *    |                                     |                             |
 * ---+-------------------------------------+-----------------------------+-->
 *    ^                                     ^                             ^
 * V[i-1].end                           V[i].start                    V[i].end
 * ```
 * Lastly, here is how the TRAVEL, BREAKS, DELAY and WAIT can be arranged
 * during a transition.
 *
 * * They don't overlap.
 * * The DELAY is unique and *must* be a contiguous period of time right
 *   before the next visit (or vehicle end). Thus, it suffice to know the
 *   delay duration to know its start and end time.
 * * The BREAKS are contiguous, non-overlapping periods of time. The
 *   response specifies the start time and duration of each break.
 * * TRAVEL and WAIT are "preemptable": they can be interrupted several times
 *   during this transition. Clients can assume that travel happens "as soon as
 *   possible" and that "wait" fills the remaining time.
 *
 * A (complex) example:
 * ```
 *                                TRANSITION[i]
 * --++-----+-----------------------------------------------------------++-->
